## About Timescale Cloud user management
Timescale Cloud allows you to collaborate with other users on your projects.
When you have created your project, you can add other users so that they can see
your project in their Timescale Cloud console. You can add, manage, and delete
users from the `Members` section of the Cloud console.

If you are the creator of the Project, you are assigned an Administrator role,
and have the ability to add, manage, and delete other users. If you have been
added to a project, you are assigned a Member role.

## Add or remove members
You can add members to your project group from the `Members` section in your
Cloud console.  The new member does not need  to have a Timescale Cloud account
before you add them. If they do not yet have an account, they are prompted to
create one.
